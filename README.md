 Below you will find the typing game that I have made using python, to simulate a typing competition
Steps to run the game on your system:

Step1:
 make sure you have python installed in your system.

Step2:

 make sure to downlaod nltk and pygame, in your system:
 this is for nltk:

this is for pygame:

for me it shows conditions satisfied because I have already installed it, but for you the window might look different.

Step 3:

download the game folder from github and open VSCODE and run the program, hopefully it should work.
